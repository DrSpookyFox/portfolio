        <h3>Owner and Lead Developer, Ongoing Project</h3>
        <p class="lead">
          A web app to help climbers have a proper bouldering session
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Built with Vite, React, Docker, Bootstap, HTML, CSS</li>
          <li>
            One of the hardest things about rock climbing (besides gravity) is
            finding the right conditions to climb in. When it comes to
            bouldering it's especially important to have the right temps to
            climb the boulder
          </li>
          <li>
            With my 6 years of knowledge of boulders in the New York / New
            England area, I designed an app that would show you which boulders
            are available to climb based on your preferences and the current
            weather in that area
          </li>
          <li>
            The hardest challenge for me was managing state across the whole
            app. I frequently had to go back to my diagram where the state lived
            for each component. (I look forward to working with technologies
            with state management, but for this project I wanted to learn the
            hard way.) Also the sliders for the preferences page were weirdly
            hard for me to navigate.
          </li>
          <li>
            Future considerations would be to develop into a web app, build
            log-in page for users so they can record boulders they climbed, take
            that data to determine what temperatures are best for certain
            climbs, and lastly incorporate sun direction to recommendations of
            boulders to climb
          </li>
