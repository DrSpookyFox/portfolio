          A bouldering web app to help climbers have a proper session
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Built with Vite, React, Docker, Bootstap, HTML, CSS</li>
          <li>
            One of the hardest things about rock climbing (besides gravity) is
            finding the right conditions to climb in. When it comes to
            bouldering it's especially important to have the right temps to get
            the send (aka climb the boulder)
          </li>
          <li>
            I used my 6 years of knowledge of boulders in New York/New England
            and designed an app that would show you which boulders are available
            to climb based on your preferences and the current weather in that
            area
          </li>
          <li>
            The hardest challenege for me was managing state across the whole
            web app. I frequently had to go back to a map I drew of where state
            lived for each component. I look forward to working with
            technologies with state managment, but for this project I wanted to
            learn the hard way. Also the sliders for the preferences page were
            weirdly hard for me to navigate.
          </li>
          <li>
            Future considerations would be to develop into a web app, build
            login page for users so they can record boulders they climbed, take
            that data to determine what temperatures are best for certain
            climbs, and lastly incorporate sun direction to recommendations of
            boulders to climb
          </li>
